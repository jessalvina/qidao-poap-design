# DIQAO - POAP Design

Welcome! Here are some of my artworks for DiQao POAP Design

#### 1. POAPathon Challenge 1 - I voted!
**Challenge Description:** 
This POAP will be given to those who vote on our governance snapshot page https://vote.mai.finance/ The design should catch the essence of our theme culture. Get inspired by Taoism vibes and its shapes, Lao Zi is a reference but it's not a must that he's present.

#### 2. POAPathon Challenge 2 - 4 years locked
**Challenge Description:**
This POAP will be given to QI token holders who decide to lock up their QI to the maximum length, 4 years, at https://app.mai.finance/boost. The users who do that receive a multiplier of 4x in their voting power and their weekly rewards.

This is the highest commitment someone can do in Mai Finance and we want to give a POAP of appreciation to these users.

The design should catch the essence of our theme culture. Get inspired by Taoism vibes and its shapes, Lao Zi is a reference but it's not a must that he's present.

#### 3. POAPathon Challenge 3 - AMAs
**Challenge Description:** 
At QiDao we like making friends with other protocols and inviting them to our Discord to chat. This POAP will serve as proof of attendance to our future Ask Me Anything (AMA) events.

We are looking to find a style that can match our brand and give identity to our AMAs.

The design should catch the essence of our theme culture. Get inspired by Taoism vibes and its shapes, Lao Zi is a reference but it's not a must that he's present.


#### 4. POAPathon Challenge 4 - True Qimp
**Challenge Description:** 
This POAP will be given to those users who make significant contributions towards the community of QiDao. Creating content, helping others, building integrations, etc.

The Qimps (chimps) are the core users of QiDao and this will be a recognition to those who contribute the most.

The design should catch the essence of our theme culture. Get inspired by Taoism vibes and its shapes, Lao Zi is a reference but it's not a must that he's present. One source of inspiration for this could be the mythical Sun Wukong.
